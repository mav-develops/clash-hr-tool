# Clash-HumanResource-Tool
This bot is for competitive clans who need more convenient tools for their recruitments 

as a recruiter, I found myself, 
quite often wanted to save interveiw history and anytime I could recall 
easily to open an interview channel without having worries of setting secure roles 
always wanted to have shortcuts for a welcome messages or something else without typing whoel phrase again and again 

in the discord server always confused between members and their accounts these days seeing one guy having onely one account is really rare, most people have serveral accounts in a clan and other clans 
and the in-game-name and discord name are not matching 

so startred building this bot for a clan called War Bees. it worked and I hope it helps other clans as well 




1. add your discord server 

2. add roles to allow to use bot commands 

3. enjoy it ;)
