# Clash-HumanResource-Tool
This bot is for competitive clans who need more convenient tools for their recruitments 

as a recruiter, I found myself, 
1.quite often wanted to save interveiw history and anytime I could recall 
2.easily to open an interview channel without having worries of setting secure roles 
3.always wanted to have shortcuts for a welcome messages or something else without typing whoel phrase again and again 
4.I usually get confused names between members and their accounts. These days, seeing one guy having only one account is really rare, most people have serveral accounts in a clan or other clans. And in-game-names and discord names are not the same





1. add your discord server 

2. add roles to allow to use bot commands 

3. enjoy it ;)
